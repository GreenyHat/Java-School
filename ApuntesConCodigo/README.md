# :book: About this Repository

This repository has a clear and ambitious purpose:

## :mag: Exploration through Curiosity

We believe that curiosity is the driving force behind learning. That's why our goal is to:
- Provide **code solutions** accompanied by detailed explanations.
- In the future, answer those intriguing questions like "what would happen if I tweak this?" or "what if I try it that way?".

## :bulb: Learn by Doing

The best way to grasp programming isn't just by reading or listening, but by **doing**. Here, we champion that hands-on learning approach. We encourage you to experiment, break things, fix them, and through that journey, grow as a developer.


:heart: **Your involvement is crucial**. If you have curiosities or suggestions, dive right in! This community thrives on contributions like yours.

# Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
